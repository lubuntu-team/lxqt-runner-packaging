Comment: The source for this package has been repacked in order to exclude
 a non-DFSG-compliant ICC color profile from Adobe. A couple of the icons
 (vbox-icons/state_running_16px.png and vbox-icons/vrdp_16px.png) had a
 proprietary profile embedded. The ICC profiles have been replaced with GIMP's
 public domain sRGB profile.
